# DelGen

Generates Deli manifests from terminal prompts to the user.

## Instructions

1. Download `DelGen.exe` from the [releases](https://github.com/nayr31/DelGen/releases/) page.
2. Move it to the folder that contains your mod folders/files. Here are some examples:

    Example 1:

    ```text
    MyMod/
        areallyweirdgun
        areallyweirdgun.manifest
        crazyscripttomakeitwork.dll
        DelGen.exe
    ```

    Example 2:

    ```text
    MyMod/
        AReallyCoolCharacter/
            character.json
            sosig_buff_dude.json
            vault_file_or_something
        DelGen.exe
    ```

3. Open `DelGen.exe`. Your antivirus may prevent the program from writing files, so it is up to you if you want to run it as administrator.
4. Follow the on screen prompts.
5. After it has finished, a file called `manifest.json` will be created next to your files.
6. Pack your files and `manifest.json` as a `.zip`, then rename the file extension to `.deli`.
